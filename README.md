Python Projects for coding night

The first project is an ASCII Value calculator.
It takes input from the user and inserts the input into the asciivalue function.
In this function there is a counter, the input is converted to a list to make itteration possible.
With each letter in the iteration the ordinal value is found and added to the counter.
When all values have been added the total is printed out to see.


The second project is Netflix Logo recreation.
Importing and using the turtle I created a quick application the retraces the netflix logo in a window.
Once the logo has been recreated the application closes itself.


The third project is a very simple calculator only capable of doing two input equations.
It takes three inputs namely the first number, the symbol depending on what type of equation and the second number.
After all inputs have been taken, the equation is done and printed for the user.


The fourth project is a project manager application.
The application consists of a login with users already registerd. Once the login is succesfull a menu with muliple options is displayed.
The application was originally a capstone project of my HyperionDev bootcamp, a construction company would be able to use this application with all details
needed for a construction site that can be added to it's records.
All records added through the application are written and stored in notepad text files.
This is the Python version of the application. The project was further developed in Java also using MySQL for databases.
